### **🌌 Once Upon a Time in Code…**  

Hi, I'm **SOLGINEER**—part-time **blockchain wizard**, full-time **tech alchemist**, and occasional **AI whisperer**.  

My journey began when I realized computers were just overgrown calculators with trust issues. So I taught them to **trust strangers on the internet** (hello, blockchain!) and **think for themselves** (hello, AI!). Now I split my time between:  

- 🎮 **Building digital worlds** where NFTs have more drama than a reality TV show ([Gangs of the Meta](https://play.gangsofthemeta.io), my blockchain game)  
- 🧠 **Training AI models** that may or may not be plotting a polite takeover (research @ [Aalto University](https://research.aalto.fi))  
- 🌐 **Launching side quests** like [Kadido](https://kadido-bsc.netlify.app/)—because why *shouldn't* finance feel like a video game?  

**Fun fact:** I once debugged a smart contract while skydiving (metaphorically, but the adrenaline was real).  

### **🚀 Why Work With Me?**  
- I speak **"decentralized"** and **"machine learning"** fluently, but also **"human"**  
- My code has **fewer bugs than my houseplants** (RIP, fern)  
- I believe **the best tech solves problems—and makes you grin while doing it**  

Let's build the future. *(Preferably one where robots bring us coffee.)*
